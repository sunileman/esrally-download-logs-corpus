esEsRally Logs Track Dataset Download Script

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script designed for downloading specific files from a predefined JSON configuration. The script processes entries in the JSON, modifies them according to specified rules, and downloads files to a local directory. It's particularly tailored for use with rally-track configurations in Elasticsearch.

## Features

- Parses a JSON file hosted at a specific URL.
- Processes each entry in the JSON, excluding certain specified entries.
- For each processed entry, constructs a download URL and a local filename.
- Downloads each file to a specified local directory.
- The local filename is created by replacing a placeholder in the `source_file` field with the value from the `target_data_stream` field.

## How It Works

The script performs the following operations:

1. Fetches JSON content from a provided URL.
2. Parses the JSON to extract relevant data about files to be downloaded.
3. Excludes specific entries from processing (currently entries 4-6).
4. Processes remaining entries to construct download URLs and local filenames:
   - The download URL is constructed from the `base_url` and `source_file` fields in each JSON entry.
   - The local filename is generated by replacing `"document"` in the `source_file` field with the value from the `target_data_stream` field.
5. Downloads each file to the specified directory (`./rally-download/` by default).

## Usage

To use the script:

1. Ensure Python 3 and `requests` library are installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script.
3. Run the script using Python.
4. Downloaded files will be available in the specified download directory.

## Customization

You can customize the script by modifying the following:

- `url`: The URL where the JSON content is hosted.
- `number_of_loops`: Controls the number of duplicate entries created for each original entry.
- `download_file_location`: The local directory where files will be downloaded.
